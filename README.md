# SortingVisualizer
## Overview
The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application built with React that allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It displays a visual representation of sorting operations on an array, helping users understand algorithms like **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort** in real time.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where you can:
- Generate a random array of numbers.
- Select a sorting algorithm to visualize.
- Watch the array being sorted step-by-step with animations.

This project aims to enhance understanding of basic sorting algorithms by offering a visual representation of each algorithm's behavior.

## Features
- **Visual Sorting:** Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms with animated array bars.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort** to see how they sort the array.
- **Responsive UI:** Adaptable for different screen sizes with easy-to-use controls.
- **Random Array Generation:** Create a new random array every time with the click of a button.
- **Step-by-Step Sorting:** Watch the array being sorted one step at a time with smooth transitions.
- **Customizable Array Size:** Adjust the number of bars (array size) to suit different needs.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** Used for building the user interface and managing state.
- **CSS:** Custom styling to provide a clean and attractive visual experience.
- **JavaScript:** For the implementation of sorting algorithms and logic behind animations.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one item at a time by comparing each new element with the elements before it and placing it in its correct position.
3. **Selection Sort:** Divides the array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

## How to Run
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
This step ensures that all the necessary libraries and packages are installed.

4. **Run the application:**
After the installation is complete, start the development server to view the app in your browser.

This will launch the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use
1. **Generate Random Array:** Click the **"Generate Array"** button to create a random array of integers, represented as bars on the screen.
2. **Select Algorithm:** Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Selection Sort).
3. **Start Sorting:** Click the **"Start Sorting"** button to begin sorting the array with the selected algorithm. The sorting process will be visualized step-by-step.
4. **Watch the Sorting Process:** As the array is being sorted, bars will change colors, and their heights will animate to reflect the sorting process.

## Customization
- **Change Array Size:** You can modify the number of elements in the array to make the visualization more or less complex. You can modify the code to allow users to adjust this.
- **Adjust Speed:** You can adjust the sorting speed by changing the delay times in the algorithm implementations.
